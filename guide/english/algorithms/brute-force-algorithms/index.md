## Brute Force Algorithms

Brute Force. The Brute Force is a revolutionary tool for forcible entry that is also designed to marry with our Tri-Bar (or any halligan). This tool is a sledge hammer with benefits. It has a sledge head for driving the Tri-Bar, a chisel/axe edge for cutting/ripping and a marrying slot for the Tri-Bar
Another example: 5 digit password, in the worst case scenario would take 10<sup>5</sup> tries to crack.

The time complexity of brute force is <b> O(n*m) </b>. So, if we were to search for a string of 'n' characters in a string of 'm' characters using brute force, it would take us n * m tries.
